which should we prefer strings and symbols ? and why ?

    Every time a string is written, it creates a new object with a new place in memory,
    even if the string is textually identical to an existing string. However, since symbols are immutable,
    they always refer to the same object and the same place in memory.
    
    Symbols come in handy when you need a unique identifier to hold a value, such as a key in a hash.

    
    So  If the textual content of the object is important, use a String. If the identity of the object is important, use a Symbol.
