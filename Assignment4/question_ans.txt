1) Difference between loop and iteration

    loop :-  
    
        Loop allows you to tell your program to do something a certain number of times,
        or until a certain condition is met.

        loops can go to infinite if termination condition fail.

    iterator : 
        
        Itretot is a way to operate on a collection object, 
        like an array, and do something with each element in that collection.

        it does not go in to infinite

         words = ["one", "two", "three", "four"]

        # loop               vs.           iterator

        i = 0                              words.each do |w|
        while i < words.length                         
        puts words[i]                      puts w
        i += 1
        end                                end


2) Difference between strptime and strftime 
        
        strptime: 
        
            strptime being short for "parse time" 
            strptime means string parser, this will convert a string format to datetime.
        
        strftime: 
            
            strftime being short for "formatting time."
            strftime means string formatter, this will format a datetime object to string format.
 

 3) Why readines was not printing \n?

        compiler treat  \n as a new line creator so when we try to print it compiler replace with 
        new line if we want to print \n then you need to write "\\n" .


         

 4) why "ruby file_copy.rb < sometext.txt > everything.txt"  command first started writing from sometext.txt into file_copy.rb and 
    not directly writing to everything.txt

     
     file_copy.rb first take a sometext.txt as a input and then output of the file_copy.rb overwrite into everything.txt
